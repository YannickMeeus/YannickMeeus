I'm historically a back-end engineer, having worked on payments integration systems, warehouse integration systems, a full Dealer Management Software offering, Facebook integrations, authorization and authentication systems, real-time notifications, and various other bits and bobs. I've started diving deeper into the whole Platform/DevOps/Cloud topic in more recent times, but I never stray too far from the code that powers it all.

In my spare time I:
- parent - I have a newly initialised son
- cook - Recently I've started rediscovering my heritage and I'm trying to cook a lot of North African dishes. Results have been... mixed
- read - Fantasy/Science Fiction mostly, I tried some more serious stuff but it never quite gets me into the thick of things in quite the same way. I'm dabbling in some Lovecraftian stuff more recently, which is a nice change of tone
- learn - Currently trying to learn Rust. It's been a journey, lemme tell you

At the moment I'm focusing on building out the developer platform and multi-account cloud architecture at Mapbox, which includes levelling up our cloud engineering expertise whilst keeping our costs under control, coaching engineers on their path to cloud-native application architectures, and engaging with all manner of stakeholders to ensure my team's building the right things in the right way at the right time.

## ‚ùì And where is all of your stuff?

I collect most of my side-hustle work under a separate organisation, called [Silly Goose Software](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/).
There you find such classics as:
- [Messaging Advocacy](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/messaging-advocacy) - An attempt at illustrating a publish-subscribe paradigm on top of RabbitMQ.
- [Event Sauced](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/event-sauced-ts) - An event sourcing plugin library
- [Kortteli Kauppa Stock Checker](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/kortteli-kauppa-stock-checker) ~~WIP - more details in that particular README. Once it's done, I'll rewrite it into Rust.~~ I never managed to finish this, and the company has since gone into administration. The code is a decent thought experiment on CQS (not CQRS, that's a different beast), and an example of the [composition root](https://freecontent.manning.com/dependency-injection-in-net-2nd-edition-understanding-the-composition-root/) pattern, which is one of my all-time favourites when it comes to application composition and testability.
