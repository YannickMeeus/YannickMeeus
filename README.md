I'm historically a back-end engineer, having worked on payments integration systems, warehouse integration systems, a full Dealer Management Software offering, and various other bits and bobs.

Currently I'm focusing on coaching, leadership, and engineering excellence over at the [smartly.io Creative Group](https://www.smartly.io/blog/meet-our-product-groups-creative-group)

In my spare time I:
- parent - I have a newly initialised son
- cook - Recently I've started rediscovering my heritage and I'm trying to cook a lot of North African dishes. Results have been... mixed
- read - Fantasy/Science Fiction mostly, I tried some more serious stuff but it never quite gets me into the thick of things in quite the same way
- learn - Currently trying to learn Ruby (on Rails) and Rust (on Rocket). It's been a journey, lemme tell you

## ‚ùì And where is all of your stuff?

I collect any and all work under a separate organisation, called [Silly Goose Software](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/).
There you find such classics as:
- [Event Sauced](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/event-sauced-ts) - An event sourcing plugin library
- [Goose](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/goose/blob/main/cmd/root.go) WIP - Very much not even close to being started, but I wanted to try this new CLI library *and* learn Go.
- [Kortteli Kaupa Stock Checker](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/kortteli-kauppa-stock-checker) WIP - A full stack project with Rails on the backend, more details in that particular README
