I'm historically a back-end engineer, having worked on payments integration systems, warehouse integration systems, a full Dealer Management Software offering, Facebook integrations, authorization and authentication systems, real-time notifications, navigation and mapping systems, and various other bits and bobs. I've started diving deeper into the whole Platform/DevOps/Cloud topic recently, but I never stray too far from the code that powers it all.

In my spare time I:
- parent - I have a three year old
- cook - Recently I've started rediscovering my heritage and I'm trying to cook a lot of North African dishes. Results have been great, honestly.
- read - Fantasy/Science Fiction mostly, I tried some more serious stuff but it never quite gets me into the thick of things in quite the same way. I'm dabbling in some Lovecraftian stuff more recently, which is a nice change of tone
- learn - Currently learning to build robust Go services. I'm focusing on a monolith because why the heck not?

At the moment I'm focusing on building out [the productisation and commercialisation layer over at ICEYE](https://www.iceye.com/sar-data), which means I'm working with proper rocket scientists. No joke, it's awesome and I'm learning new stuff every day.

## ‚ùì And where is all of your stuff?

I collect most of my side-hustle work under a separate organisation, called [Silly Goose Software](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/).
There you find such classics as:
- [Messaging Advocacy](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/messaging-advocacy) - An attempt at illustrating a publish-subscribe paradigm on top of RabbitMQ.
- [Event Sauced](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/event-sauced-ts) - An event sourcing plugin library
- [Kortteli Kauppa Stock Checker](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/kortteli-kauppa-stock-checker) ~~WIP - more details in that particular README. Once it's done, I'll rewrite it into Rust.~~ I never managed to finish this, and the company has since gone into administration. The code is a decent thought experiment on CQS (not CQRS, that's a different beast), and an example of the [composition root](https://freecontent.manning.com/dependency-injection-in-net-2nd-edition-understanding-the-composition-root/) pattern, which is one of my all-time favourites when it comes to application composition and testability.
