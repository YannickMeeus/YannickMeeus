I'm historically a back-end engineer, having worked on payments integration systems, warehouse integration systems, a full Dealer Management Software offering, Facebook integrations, authorization and authentication systems, real-time notifications, and various other bits and bobs.

In my spare time I:
- parent - I have a newly initialised son
- cook - Recently I've started rediscovering my heritage and I'm trying to cook a lot of North African dishes. Results have been... mixed
- read - Fantasy/Science Fiction mostly, I tried some more serious stuff but it never quite gets me into the thick of things in quite the same way. I'm dabbling in some Lovecraftian stuff more recently, which is a nice change of tone
- learn - Currently trying to learn Rust. It's been a journey, lemme tell you

## ‚ùì And where is all of your stuff?

I collect most of my side-hustle work under a separate organisation, called [Silly Goose Software](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/).
There you find such classics as:
- [Event Sauced](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/event-sauced-ts) - An event sourcing plugin library
- [Kortteli Kauppa Stock Checker](https://github.com/Silly-Goose-Software/kortteli-kauppa-stock-checker) WIP - more details in that particular README. Once it's done, I'll rewrite it into Rust.

I do have a bunch of "learning" repos that I've started pushing to my personal organisation. These will typically be named "language"-"scenario", such as [rust-host-an-api](https://github.com/YannickMeeus/rust-host-an-api) or [golang-work-with-files](https://github.com/YannickMeeus/golang-work-with-files). These are extremely simply things to achieve, but give me a good enough idea on how a language/stack hangs together.
